# Password Generator - George Oustapasidis    


## Description

In this project, our objective was to write and create an Application that one can use to generate a password. They would have some criteria which will specify the likely-hood of the password. This app will be displayed in a browser page. 

Our app has to showcase our ability to create :

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
